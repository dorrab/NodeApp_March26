			<h2>What is Jenkins X?/h2>
			<p>To understand intricacies and inner workings of Jenkins X, 
			we need to understand Kubernetes. But, you do not need to 
			understand Kubernetes to use Jenkins X. That is one of the main 
			contributions of the project. Jenkins X allows us to harness the 
			power of Kubernetes without spending an eternity learning the 
			ever-growing list of the things it does. Jenkins X helps us by 
			simplifying complex processes into concepts that can be adopted 
			quickly and without spending months in trying to figure out “the 
			right way to do stuff.” It helps by removing and simplifying some 
			of the problems caused by the overall complexity of Kubernetes and 
			its ecosystem. If you are indeed a Kubernetes ninja, you will appreciate 
			all the effort put into Jenkins X. If you’re not, you will be able to 
			jump right in and harness the power of Kubernetes without ripping your 
			hair out of frustration caused by Kubernetes complexity./p>
